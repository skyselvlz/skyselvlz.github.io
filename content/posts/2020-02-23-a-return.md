## DISCLAIMER ##
Okay so at first I really want this space to be clean, perfect, and nicely depicting my journey and progression and such, but <b>WELP WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT</b>, it has been two and a half years since I last wrote something here, and I think that well what's there to lose anymore, might as well start to write scribbles and random stuff here so <b><u>here we go</u></b>.

And another disclaimer, as you may see there will be a <b>lot</b> of grammatical error and such starting from now cause unlike my first post I don't proofread this one and just go with anything that will force me to write <b>LITERALLY ANYTHING</b> so don't flame me for it <sub>(cuz I'm insecure as f*ck)</sub>.

So for now I'm writing random stuff that pops up in my mind, when I have time to, in hope it will kick something off and legit making quality content <sub>(I hope so)</sub>.

I'm still trying to figure out on my own how to fully operate this cuz I'm kinda dumb, so expect some stupid variance in future writing <sub>(if any)</sub>.

## Here we go ##

It's [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct6BUPvE2sM "It's the pineapple one") damn song. 

But hey, I'm gonna tell you the <b>second</b> most viewed J-pop music video, cuz it's kinda good, I kinda like it, and I want to share it.

[![Wut](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SX_ViT4Ra7k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX_ViT4Ra7k)
I don't f*ckin know how to put youtube vid in this, sry for the inconvenience

It's Lemon by [Kenshi Yonezu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenshi_Yonezu "ur welcome") [(Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1snhtMLeb2DYoMOcVbb8iB?si=lEj4KK_yS7en4RIkIV-2fA), the dude got some mad skillz in making music cause I really like all of his songs <sub>or maybe its cuz of my basic taste</sub>. But really, go check him out, he used to release Vocaloid music under the name "hachi", if you're into that as well <sub>which i dont</sub>.

Some of his music that I personally like is [Spirits of the Sea] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s84rIhPuhk "bEAUTIFUL MV I must say") for its synth sound or anything that is <sub>I've got zero knowledge in music</sub>, and [Paprika] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s582L3gujnw "beautiful aesthetics as well"), which is actually a song he writes for [Foorin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0valuAksuo), group of child singers for the 2018 Olympics.

Some of his other notable works are [Loser] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx_fKPBPYUI) (he dance like madman in this one), [Orion] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzAyrgSqeeE) (this is a slower and a more "grand" song), [Uma to Shika] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptnYBctoexk "Its 'Horse and Deer' in English") (his newest release), and [Peace sign] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aJVr5tTTWk "MHA OP I kno") (for u weebs out there). Other songs that are also good but I'm too lazy to link it in includes "Flamingo", "Haiirotoao", "Uchiagehanabi" and "Shunrai". FYI, I'm only giving songs that is also on global spotify, cause that is my main platform for music streaming, dude got lots of other songs that is regio-locked like [Eine Kleine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EKxzId_Sj4), among all. In my conclusion, dude is a bop.

And if you don't have better things to do, go stream [Lemon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX_ViT4Ra7k) and let it beat that pineapple shit for the most viewed J-pop MV, it's [12M view away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_dmJB8JzSA).

So yeah that's it, I'm "promoting" an artist who is already a big name in Japan, and doesn't really give anything deeper than personal preference and single wikipedia search, I'm gonna call that a good start.

## DISCLOSURE ##
So yeah this is what I'll be doing for this site for now, writing random shit and "training" my writing skills cause believe it or not, it tooks me <b>HOURS</b> to finish this shitty writing. I really think if I want to do something then I really should be doing it instead of waiting "for the right moment". I personally targeting myself to write at least once a month if I have the time (low standards I know). Let me know if you have any ideas on what I should do next <sub>(if u see this u probably know me already)</sub>, or go email me on skyselvlz@gmail.com. 

<i>Live well~</i>
