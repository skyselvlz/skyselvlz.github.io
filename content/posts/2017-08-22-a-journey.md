Hello!, as you can see from the image above, I've got some story to tell.

The picture above was taken on 11<sup>th</sup> August 2017<sub>iirc</sub>. Our second attempt, your future healthcare worker, students of Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Indonesia 2017 ([FKUI 2017](http://www.fkui2017.org/ "FKUI 2017 Official Website")) to capture all of us in a single frame. The picture may not be perfect, but our efforts have been the *__best__*.

We have surpassed a journey, a journey to which some (including me) finds hard and difficult to adjust to, but nonetheless small as to what will come in near future. In that journey, we learn so much, we learn the importance of others, we learn to stay together, we learn discipline, respect, commitment, attitude, and willpower needed for the day to come. What we have took from this journey shall be our foundation for us to walk on the path we have chosen for the future, the path of becoming a *__doctor__*.

We came here and proclaim ourself as a hope. We are the hope of others, we are the hope of our parents, we are the hope of our society, we are the hope of humanity, and I believe that we can reach that height, reach that expectation if we work, *__together__*

We came here in differences. We came here with each of our strength and flaw, and it's okay to have a flaw because we are *human*, we will work *together* to cover each of our own weakness to reach our full potential and become the best, *__a perfection in imperfection__*. As for the closing, I'd like to quote a certain African Proverb which I heard from a great senior duuring the journey

> *__"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."__*

Thank you very much for reading this, and thank you very much for all the people that allows me to experience this __journey__. I can't thank you all enough.

*FKUI 2017, HARAPAN!*

*"Dum spiro spero"*

While I breathe, I hope
