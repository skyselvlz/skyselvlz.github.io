I know I'm late but I just want to say, <b>stay safe y'all</b>. Keep your hands clean, cough etiquette, and please do [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6717166/what-is-physical-distancing/ "yeah they recently changed the term"). Kindly seeks help through hotline and your nearby healthcare worker if you had symptoms <sub> do refers to your country guidelines, being paranoid won't help either in this situation </sub>. If you're in good health and want to help, please do search for initiative for donation either for food, basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), or other logistical needs they might need, I'm sure there are tons of it already by now.
