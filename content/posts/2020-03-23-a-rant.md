I know I'm late by now but I just want to say, <b>stay safe y'all</b>. Keep your hands clean, cough etiquette, and please do [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6717166/what-is-physical-distancing/ "yeah they recently changed the term"). Kindly seeks help through hotline and your nearby healthcare worker if you had symptoms <sub> do refers to your country guidelines, being paranoid won't help either in this situation </sub>. If you're in good health and want to help, please do search for initiative for donation either for food, basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), or other logistical needs they might need, I'm sure there are tons of it already by now.

If you want to know the global progress case I suggest you either go to [this site](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ "World Meter") or [this site](https://covid19.health/ "dem visuals") (this one has good visual). If you are somehow interested in the virus pylogeny, you can go [here](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global "Nextstrain"). I guess that's it for now, see ya.

Okay so I know I said I will post monthly but turns out I really can't <sub>even with this low standards</sub>. Can't seem to find time to do this <sub> even this small sh*t took a while</sub>. I'll try to post just a little bit more cause of this long distance learning actually giving me some extra leisure time (which I mostly used to sleep), would be really good if I can do some productive things <sub> I consider this as productive cause it's much more meaningful than sleeping </sub>, so yeah, expect some more, I guess.
