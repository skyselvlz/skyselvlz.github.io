Shit. Time to rant.

Life has not been so nice.. lately. Don't get me wrong, thank you for those who are with me and accompany me for the past couple of time, really grateful for all of you

But life is indeed harder for me lately, albeit it's not my hardest time personally, it's maybe the hardest for most of us
