Shit. Time to rant.

Before all of this rant, just want to say, <b>stay safe y'all</b>. Keep your hands clean, cough etiquette, and please do [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6717166/what-is-physical-distancing/ "yeah they recently changed the term"). Kindly seeks help through hotline and your nearby healthcare worker if you had symptoms <sub> do refers to your country guidelines, being paranoid won't help either in this situation </sub>. If you're in good health and want to help, please do search for initiative for donation either for food, basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), or other logistical needs they might need, I'm sure there are tons of it already by now.

Life has not been so nice.. lately. Don't get me wrong, thank you for those who are with me and accompany me for the past couple of time, really grateful for all of you

But life is indeed harder for me lately, albeit it's not my hardest time personally, it's maybe the hardest for most of us.
