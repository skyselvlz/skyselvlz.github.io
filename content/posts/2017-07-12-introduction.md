Hello!, in this first post I will tell briefly about the what, why, and how I create and run this site.


__First things first__, *what is this site?* Well to be honest I don't exactly know either, as to I don't know what this site will **specifically** dedicated to.

> So as for now, this site is used as *a media to show others what I want to show, whether it's something I like, something I want to share, or perhaps a project that I've been working on*, *yep* sounds about right.


__Second things second__, *why do you create this site?* Well to be honest I don't exactly know either, as to I don't know the **sole purpose** to why I build this site.

> So as for now, this site is created because of *my personal urge to have a writing space, to somehow act as a diversion, and honestly to kill some time*, *yep* sounds about right.


__Third things third__, *how do you create this site?* Well to be honest I don't exactly know either, as to I don't know how do I actually **build** this site <sub>ineedhelp</sub>.

> So as for now, this site is not built by me but rather *built by a [great friend](https://laymonage.com/ "laymonage") and I, with him doing 99% of the work from A to Z*, *yep* that's exactly right.

> If you're interested as to what tools are used, you can check out his post [here](https://laymonage.com/mula/ "Mula (ID)") in Indonesian.


__Last things last__, I'm really grateful to the person who help me and took great care of me, thank you very much for reading, *Live Well\~~*.
